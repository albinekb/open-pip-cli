You can also pipe any video URL to `open-pip`. For example, using the [ytdl](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ytdl) module, you can play a YouTube video:

```sh
yarn global add ytdl
ytdl _HSylqgVYQI --print-url | open-pip
```

Using the [twitch-url-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/twitch-url-cli) module, you can stream a Twitch channel (you need a Twitch client ID though)

```sh
yarn global add twitch-url-cli
echo "abcdefghijklmno12345" > ~/.twitch-client-id
twitch-url BobRoss | open-pip
```

Let us know if you have examples for more services.

## Install

### yarn

```sh
yarn global add open-pip-cli
```

### npm
```sh
npm install --global open-pip-cli
```

## Requirements
As the native picture-in-picture player is only available in macOS Sierra (10.12) and above, this module will also only work with those versions.
